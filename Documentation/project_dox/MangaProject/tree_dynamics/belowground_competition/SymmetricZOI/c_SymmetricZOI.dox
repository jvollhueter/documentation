SymmetricZOI below-ground competition concept. 

This concept describes competition for water based on the intersection of root plates and returns a factor between 0 and 1 for each tree
Resources are shared equally. 
For more information see ODD of the BETTINA-model (appendix of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.10.005).


Please note:  
- Number of individuals (_n_individuals_) in *initial_population* must be >= 1.
- Cell edge must be larger than the minimum (initial) root radius
    + Example: initial root radius = 0.2 m, cell edge must be larger than 0.2 m, i.e., length of model domain / resolution > 0.2
