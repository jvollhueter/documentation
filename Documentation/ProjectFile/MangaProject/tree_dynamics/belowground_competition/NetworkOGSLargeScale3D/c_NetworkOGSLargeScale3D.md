`NetworkOGSLargeScale3D` below-ground competition concept. 
This concept combines `OGSLargeScale3D` and `SimpleNetwork` (for more information see respective concepts).  

The concept returns a value between 0 and 1 for each tree added to it. 
Hereby, the reduction factor is calculated as the fraction of available water and the hypothetical maximal water uptake at zero salinity.
The available water considers soil salinity and water exchange through root grafts.  

All files and parameters required are similar to `OGSLargeScale3D`  and `SimpleNetwork`.
