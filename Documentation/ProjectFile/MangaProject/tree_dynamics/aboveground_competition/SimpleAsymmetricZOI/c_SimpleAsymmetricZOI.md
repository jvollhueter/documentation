SimpleAsymmetricZOI aboveground competition concept. This concept returns a factor 0...1 for each tree specifying the unshaded proportion of the crown area.

Please note:  
- Number of individuals (_n_individuals_) in *initial_population* must be >= 1.
- Cell edge must be larger than the minimum (initial) crown radius
    + Example: initial crown radius = 0.2 m, cell edge must be larger than 0.2 m, i.e., length of model domain / resolution > 0.2
