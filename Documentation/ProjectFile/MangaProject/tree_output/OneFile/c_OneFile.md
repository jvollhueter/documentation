This case creates one file for the whole simulation  (this is a combination of `OneTreeOneFile` and `OneTimestepOneFile`).  
In each line the tree id, the position, the time and predefined parameters and geometric measures are saved.

> Note: Files can grow very large (due to small time steps and many individuals).
