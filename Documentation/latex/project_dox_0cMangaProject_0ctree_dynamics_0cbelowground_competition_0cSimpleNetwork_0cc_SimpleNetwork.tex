Simple\+Network below-\/ground competition concept.

This concept allows the formation of groups of root grafted trees. Within these groups trees can exchange water driven by the water potential gradient between connected trees. The model consists of three \textquotesingle{}sub-\/models\textquotesingle{} ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Group formation
\item Initialization of the root graft formation process
\item Calculation of below-\/ground resources

Group formation$\ast$$\ast$ ~\newline
 In this sub-\/model the formation of is groups of connected trees in managed. Based on tree variables ({\itshape partners}), a graph dictionary and a link list a generated.

Initialization rgf process$\ast$$\ast$ ~\newline
 The formation of root grafts between a pair of trees will be initialized when the following conditions are met ~\newline

\item the root plates of trees overlap (i.\+e. distance between trees $<$ sum of root radii)
\item the contact probability (i.\+e. 1 -\/ distance/r\+\_\+root\+\_\+ij) is smaller than a randomly generated number
\item the trees are not already connected with one another
\item the trees are currently not in the process of rgf with one another

Below-\/ground resources$\ast$$\ast$
\end{DoxyItemize}

In this concept, three volume flows describe the water flow in the tree\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape water\+\_\+absorbed} that is the water absorbed by the tree from the soil column
\item {\itshape water\+\_\+available} that is the water available for tree growth and maintenance, which corresponds to water uptake in the Simple\+Bettina model
\item {\itshape water\+\_\+exchanged} that is the water exchanged between connected trees
\end{DoxyItemize}

The volume flows are calculated utilizing the electronic-\/hydraulic analogy. This allows the application of the Kirchhoff\textquotesingle{}s laws, resulting in a set of linear equations.

This concept returns a multiplier for water loss or gain. This class is the basis (parent) for further Network concepts such as Network\+Fixed\+Salinity.
