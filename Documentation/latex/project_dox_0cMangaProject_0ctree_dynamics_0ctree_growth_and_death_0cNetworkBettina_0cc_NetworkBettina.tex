Network\+Bettina death and growth concept. This concepts allows water exchange between root grafted trees. The concept is based on the Bettina single tree model as described in the ODD (appendix of \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.10.005}{\texttt{ https\+://doi.\+org/10.\+1016/j.\+ecolmodel.\+2018.\+10.\+005}}).

The concept only works with a Network belowground concept.
